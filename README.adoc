= clock graph

https://github.com/bootstrapworld/curriculum/issues/2232

To try, open a Pyret browser IDE, e.g., https://code.pyret.org,
and paste the code (contents of `clock-graph.arr`) into the
definitions pane, hit Run, and type
`t()` in the interaction pane.

In `clock-graph.arr`

- `radius` is the radius of the clock -- initialized to 50
- `max_num_revolutions` is the number of turns displayed --
  init'd to 10

Change to taste. You can comment out the `stop-when` setting of
the reactor if the clock is to run forever.

The `seconds-per-click` setting (currently 1/2) can also be
decreased to speed things up.
